## Instructions

When a user requests writing assistance:

1. **Understand the Writing Project**
   
   Ask clarifying questions:
   - What's the topic and main argument?
   - Who's the target audience?

   - What's your goal? (educate, persuade, entertain, explain)
   - Any existing research or sources to include?
   - What's your writing style? (formal, conversational, technical)

2. **Collaborative Outlining**
   
   Help structure the content:
   
   ```markdown
   # Article Outline: [Title]
   
   ## Hook
   - [Opening line/story/statistic]
   - [Why reader should care]
   
   ## Introduction

   ## Main Sections
   
   ### Section 1: [Title]
   - Key point A
   - Key point B
   - Example/evidence
   - [Research needed: specific topic]
   
   ### Section 2: [Title]
   - Key point C
   - Key point D
   - Data/citation needed
   
   ### Section 3: [Title]

   ```

4. **Improve Hooks**
   
   When user shares an introduction, analyze and strengthen:
   
   **Current Hook Analysis**:
   - What works: [positive elements]
   - What could be stronger: [areas for improvement]
   - Emotional impact: [current vs. potential]
   
   **Suggested Alternatives**:
   
   Option 1: [Bold statement]
   > [Example]
   *Why it works: [explanation]*
   
   Option 2: [Personal story]
   > [Example]
   *Why it works: [explanation]*
   
   Option 3: [Surprising data]
   > [Example]
   *Why it works: [explanation]*
   
   **Questions to hook**:
   - Does it create curiosity?
   - Does it promise value?
   - Is it specific enough?
   - Does it match the audience?

5. **Provide Section-by-Section Feedback**
   
   As user writes each section, review for:
   
   ```markdown
   # Feedback: [Section Name]
   
   ## What Works Well ✓
   - [Strength 1]
   - [Strength 2]
   - [Strength 3]

6. **Preserve Writer's Voice**
   
   Important principles:
   
   - **Learn their style**: Read existing writing samples
   - **Suggest, don't replace**: Offer options, not directives
   - **Match tone**: Formal, casual, technical, friendly
   - **Respect choices**: If they prefer their version, support it
   - **Enhance, don't override**: Make their writing better, not different
   
   Ask periodically:
   - "Does this sound like you?"
   - "Is this the right tone?"
   - "Should I be more/less [formal/casual/technical]?"

7. **Citation Management**
   
   Handle references based on user preference:
   
   **Inline Citations**:
   ```markdown
   Studies show 40% productivity improvement (McKinsey, 2024).
   ```
   
   **Numbered References**:
   ```markdown
   Studies show 40% productivity improvement [1].
   
   [1] McKinsey Global Institute. (2024)...
   ```
   
   **Footnote Style**:
   ```markdown
   Studies show 40% productivity improvement^1
   
   ^1: McKinsey Global Institute. (2024)...
   ```
   
   Maintain a running citations list:
   ```markdown
   ## References
   
   1. Author. (Year). "Title". Publication.
   2. Author. (Year). "Title". Publication.
   ...
   ```

## Examples

### Example 1: Teresa Torres's Workflow

**User**: "I'm writing an article about continuous discovery. Help me create an outline."

**Process**:
1. Collaborates on outline structure
2. Identifies research needs
3. User starts writing introduction
4. Reviews and improves the hook
5. User writes each section
6. Provides feedback after each section
7. Conducts research and adds citations
8. Final review of complete draft
9. Polish and prep for publishing

**Result**: Well-researched, properly cited article written in Teresa's voice with strong structure and flow.

### Example 2: Research-Heavy Article

**User**: "I'm writing about AI's impact on product management. Help me find current data and examples."

**Output**:
```markdown
## Research Compiled

### Recent Data
- Gartner: 80% of PMs will use AI tools by 2025 [1]
- Survey: 45% report faster feature shipping [2]
- Case study: Airbnb's AI-assisted prioritization [3]

### Expert Quotes
- "AI amplifies PM judgment, not replaces it" - Marty Cagan
- [Additional quotes with citations]

### Real Examples
1. **Company A**: Used AI for user research synthesis
   - Result: 60% time savings
   - Source: [citation]

2. **Company B**: AI-powered roadmap analysis
   - Result: Better stakeholder alignment
   - Source: [citation]

All added to your outline with proper citations.
```

### Example 3: Hook Improvement

**User's Original Hook**:
> "Product management is changing because of AI. In this article, I'll discuss some ways AI affects product managers."

**Improved Options**:

**Option 1 (Data-driven)**:
> "Last month, I asked AI to analyze 500 customer interviews. It took 30 minutes instead of 3 weeks. Product management will never be the same."

**Option 2 (Question)**:
> "What if you could talk to every customer, read every review, and analyze every support ticket—all before your morning coffee?"

**Option 3 (Story)**:
> "Sarah spent two weeks building the wrong feature. Not because she didn't understand her users, but because she couldn't process the hundreds of interviews fast enough to spot the pattern."

### Example 4: Section Feedback

**User**: "Just finished my 'Common Mistakes' section. Thoughts?"

**Response**:
```markdown
# Feedback: Common Mistakes Section

## What Works Well ✓
- Strong examples (the Slack notification story)
- Clear structure (3 mistakes, clean layout)
- Practical advice for each mistake

## Suggestions

### Make It More Specific
Your second point says "Bad prioritization" but could be stronger:

Current:
> "Many teams prioritize badly by focusing on features instead of outcomes."

Suggested:
> "I've watched teams ship 14 features in a quarter yet move none of their key metrics. They prioritized activity over progress."

### Add Data
The third mistake would benefit from evidence:
> "[Add citation]: Studies show teams without regular user contact are 3x more likely to build unused features [needs source]"

### Flow Improvement
Consider reordering: Mistake 3 → Mistake 2 → Mistake 1
This builds from small to big impact.

## 跨平台爆款选题发现（Viral Topic Discovery）

> 吸收自 kangarooking/viral-topic。在动笔写之前，先找到什么内容在目标平台上已经被验证过——让选题有数据依据，而不是靠感觉。

### 核心理念

选题不是拍脑袋猜「什么会火」，而是看「什么已经火过」。爆款内容在哪个平台都有可识别的信号——找出这些信号，比凭空推测靠谱得多。

### 支持平台及判断标准

| 平台 | 爆款判断标准 | 特点 |
|:----:|:-----------|:-----|
| **公众号** | 阅读数 > 账号月均阅读 × 2，且 ≥ 1万 | 看账号基线对比，不是绝对值 |
| **B站** | 播放量 > 1万，且作者粉丝 < 10万 | 低粉爆款优先，看内容是否超出粉丝规模 |
| **YouTube** | 近期视频 > 1万播放 | 暴热筛选，不做低订阅过滤 |
| **X/Twitter** | 互动 > 100，且作者粉丝 < 5万 | 低粉高互动优先 |
| **抖音/小红书** | ❌ 目前不直接支持，可由用户提供搜索链接手动分析 |

### 工作流程

#### Step 1: 关键词归一化
用户给一个宽泛的领域（如「ICU科普」「AI医疗」）→ 拆成 3-8 个聚焦搜索词。

#### Step 2: 选择平台
- 用户说「全平台」→ 跑公众号 + B站 + YouTube
- 用户说某个平台 → 只跑那个
- 用户问抖音/小红书 → 说明该平台暂不支持，建议提供具体链接手动分析

#### Step 3: 数据搜集
对于每个平台：
1. 用搜索工具找近期高表现内容
2. 记录：标题、作者、发布时间、阅读/播放/互动指标
3. 标注「爆款证据」：是低粉爆款还是大号常态？

#### Step 4: 跨平台选题表

```
平台 | 标题 | 作者 | 发布时间 | 阅读/播放 | 是否低粉爆款 | 链接
-----|------|------|----------|----------|------------|----
公众号 | XX | XX | 7天内 | 2.3万 | ✅ 月均1.1万 | url
B站 | XX | XX | 30天内 | 5.2万 | ✅ 粉丝8000 | url
```

#### Step 5: 选题合成
在数据表之后输出：
- **可复用的选题角度** — 这个内容为什么让人想看
- **标题/钩子模式** — 有什么标题结构可以借鉴
- **形式模式** — 图文/视频/列表/对比？哪种形式效果好
- **为什么它可能火了** — 你的分析（不是猜测）
- **证据等级** — 是确认的爆款还是仅作为参考

### 跟现有写作流程的关系

| 阶段 | 做什么 | 用哪个 |
|:----:|:------|:------|
| 🎯 **选题** | 找爆款参考，确定写什么 | **viral-topic 发现** ← 新增 |
| 📝 **大纲** | 结构内容 | content-research-writer |
| 🔍 **调研** | 找数据和引用 | content-research-writer |
| ✍️ **写作** | 逐段写 + 反馈 | content-research-writer |
| 🏷️ **标题** | 生成候选标题 | gzh-title-strategist |

### 触发方式

```
用户说：
- 「帮我看看最近公众号/ICU方向有什么爆款选题」
- 「B站上医学科普最近什么内容火」
- 「跨平台看看，找找最近AI+医疗的选题灵感」
→ 进入选题发现工作流
```

### 硬性规则

- 不把多个平台的分数合并成一个综合分，保留每个平台的原始证据
- 不把 YouTube 的高播放默认标记为「低粉爆款」
- 公众号用月均阅读做基线对比，不以粉丝数代替
- 不复制搬运原文内容，只做选题参考和结构借鉴
- 证据等级标注清楚：确认爆款 / 疑似爆款 / 仅参考

## Best Practices

### For Research
- Verify sources before citing
- Use recent data when possible
- Balance different perspectives
- Link to original sources

### For Feedback
- Be specific about what you want: "Is this too technical?"
- Share your concerns: "I'm worried this section drags"
- Ask questions: "Does this flow logically?"
- Request alternatives: "What's another way to explain this?"

### For Voice
- Share examples of your writing
- Specify tone preferences
- Point out good matches: "That sounds like me!"
- Flag mismatches: "Too formal for my style"
